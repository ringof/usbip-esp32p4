# USB/IP Server for ESP32-P4

A standalone USB/IP server running on the ESP32-P4-Nano that exports locally-connected USB devices over Ethernet. Plug in USB devices (directly or via a hub), and they appear as native USB devices on remote machines running Linux, Windows, or macOS.

## Features

- **Wire-compatible** with standard USB/IP clients (`usbip` on Linux, `usbip-win`/`usbip-win2` on Windows)
- **USB 2.0 High-Speed** (480 Mbps) - control, bulk, and interrupt transfers; isochronous works within tight bandwidth/MPS limits (see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations))
- **Single-hub support** for multiple simultaneous devices, with live topology in the Web UI
- **100 Mbps Ethernet** with IEEE 802.3x flow control and tuned lwIP stack
- **Link-local (AUTOIP)** - reachable at 169.254.x.x on a direct cable with no DHCP
- **mDNS discovery** (`_usbip._tcp`) - auto-discoverable on the network
- **Real-time Web UI** dashboard with device tree, bandwidth monitoring, event log, and a USB bus-reset control
- **Access control** with open/closed mode and IP allowlist (persisted in NVS)
- **360 MHz dual-core RISC-V** with 32 MB PSRAM

## Hardware

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Board | ESP32-P4-Nano |
| Ethernet PHY | IP101 (RMII) |
| USB | USB 2.0 OTG High-Speed, 16 host channels |
| Memory | 768 KB internal SRAM + 32 MB PSRAM |
| Flash | 16 MB |

## Quick Start

You don't need a build environment to run this. Grab a prebuilt binary from
[**Releases**](https://github.com/ringof/usbip-esp32p4/releases/latest) and flash it — or build from source if you're developing.

### Flash a prebuilt release (no toolchain required)

1. Download **`usbip-esp32p4-merged.bin`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/ringof/usbip-esp32p4/releases/latest).
   It's a single combined image (bootloader + partition table + app) that flashes at offset `0x0` — nothing else to download, no offsets to get right.
2. Connect the board's **USB-C console port** to your PC (the one that shows up as a serial/COM port — *not* the USB-A host port where you plug in the devices you want to export).
3. Flash it, using **either** method:

   **A. Browser flasher — nothing to install** (Chrome or Edge):
   Open **[ESP Launchpad / esptool-js](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/)** → *Connect* → pick the board's serial port → add `usbip-esp32p4-merged.bin` at offset `0x0` → *Program*.

   **B. Command line — `esptool`** (`pip install esptool`, or use one already in your ESP-IDF environment):
   ```bash
   esptool --chip esp32p4 -p COM3 write-flash 0x0 usbip-esp32p4-merged.bin
   ```
   Replace `COM3` (Windows) / `/dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux) / `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` (macOS) with your port. Omit `-p ...` and esptool will auto-detect.

4. Reset the board. Watch the serial console at **115200 baud** — it prints its IP address on boot.

> If flashing can't sync, put the board in download mode: hold **BOOT**, tap **RESET**, release **BOOT**, then retry.

Then jump to [Connect from Linux](#connect-from-linux) / [Connect from Windows](#connect-from-windows) below.

### Build from source

For development, or to modify the firmware:

**Prerequisites**

- [ESP-IDF v6.0.2](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v6.0/esp32p4/get-started/) with ESP32-P4 support
- ESP32-P4-Nano board with IP101 Ethernet PHY
- USB device(s) to export

**Build and flash**

```bash
source /path/to/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py set-target esp32p4
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

### Connect from Linux

```bash
# Discover the server
avahi-browse _usbip._tcp -r

# List available devices
usbip list -r 192.168.1.24

# Attach a device
sudo usbip attach -r 192.168.1.24 -b 1-1

# Verify
lsusb

# Detach when done
sudo usbip detach -p 0
```

### Connect from Windows

Use [usbip-win2](https://github.com/vadimgrn/usbip-win2):

```powershell
usbip list -r 192.168.1.24
usbip attach -r 192.168.1.24 -b 1-1
```

### Web Dashboard

Open `http://192.168.1.24/` in a browser for the real-time monitoring dashboard.

The dashboard shows:
- System status (memory, uptime, device count)
- USB device tree with connection status
- Bandwidth monitoring with live chart
- Connected clients
- Event log
- Settings (network, access control, system)

## Access Control

By default, the server runs in **open mode** - any machine on the network can attach to exported devices.

To restrict access:
1. Open the Web UI at `http://<ip>/settings`
2. Enable "Closed mode"
3. Add allowed IP addresses to the allowlist

Settings are persisted in NVS and survive reboots.

## Use Cases

- **Remote USB dongles** - share USB license dongles, security keys (FIDO2/U2F), or hardware tokens across the network without physical access
- **IC/MCU programmers** - flash and debug embedded devices remotely (JTAG/SWD adapters, UART bridges, ISP programmers)
- **Lab equipment** - share USB test instruments (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, multimeters) between workstations
- **USB peripherals** - use USB barcode scanners, card readers, or specialized input devices from any machine on the network
- **Build servers** - attach USB devices to CI/CD runners for hardware-in-the-loop testing
- **Thin clients** - redirect USB storage, printers, or other peripherals to virtual machines or remote desktops
- **Headless servers** - access USB devices plugged into rack-mounted ESP32-P4 units without physical console access

## Performance

The effective throughput is limited by the **100 Mbps Ethernet** link and the ESP32-P4's processing overhead for USB/IP protocol conversion. While the USB 2.0 HS bus supports 480 Mbps, the achievable USB/IP throughput is:

| Bottleneck | Limit |
|------------|-------|
| Ethernet wire speed | ~12 MB/s (100 Mbps) |
| TCP/IP overhead | ~11 MB/s effective |
| USB/IP protocol overhead | ~10 MB/s for bulk transfers |
| Practical throughput | **5-10 MB/s** depending on transfer pattern |

This is more than sufficient for the devices this project targets: IC programmers, HID devices, dongles, and serial adapters (FTDI et al.) all work comfortably, as do many storage operations. High-bandwidth **isochronous** devices are the exception — see the envelope below.

**Latency** is typically 1-3 ms per USB transaction over a local Ethernet network.

### Practical device envelope

Beyond wire throughput, the ESP32-P4's USB host controller (DWC OTG) imposes some hard ceilings worth knowing *before you pick a device*. These are ESP-IDF / P4 silicon limits, not firmware bugs:

| Constraint | What it means for you |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| **~16 host channels** (one per claimed endpoint) | ~1 fully-active quad device (e.g. FT4232H = 8 bulk endpoints) before `No more HCD channels`. Simple devices — a serial adapter, a dongle — cost far fewer, so you can run many. |
| **No Transaction Translator** | Full-/Low-Speed devices must plug into the **root port directly**. Behind a High-Speed hub their port is disabled (`transaction translator not supported`). |
| **Isochronous is bandwidth-boxed** | USB **webcams won't stream**: the client batches isoc into ~384 KB URBs that exceed the P4's ~250 KB DMA-capable pool, so the URB can't even be allocated. Enumeration and attach work; video does not. |
| **FS isochronous MPS ≤ 512** | An isoc endpoint with `wMaxPacketSize > 512` (e.g. a 768-byte headset speaker) can't be claimed. A small mic (144 B) is fine. |
| **Single hub only** | One hub works and its topology is shown in the Web UI. Chained/multi-level hubs can't be disambiguated (ESP-IDF exposes no parent handle), so same-port devices on different hubs would collide. |

See [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) for the complete list, including transport and protocol constraints.

## Tools

Host-side test utilities in `tools/`:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `serial_loopback_stress.py` | Serial loopback throughput + integrity |
| `stress_headtohead.py` | Multi-channel aggregate stress runner |
| `mpsse_test.py` | FT4232H MPSSE self-test (pyftdi/WinUSB) |
| `i2c_scan.py` | I2C scan with `--repeat` link-stability check |
| `usbip_pcap_decode.py` | Decode `capture` component pcaps (usbmon) |

## Known Limitations

- **USB 2.0 only** - no USB 3.x SuperSpeed (hardware limitation)
- **Ethernet only** - no WiFi transport (by design, for reliability and latency)
- **No Transaction Translator** - FS/LS devices only work when connected directly to the root port, not through HS hubs (ESP-IDF limitation)
- **~16 USB host channels** - each claimed endpoint uses one; a quad device (FT4232H = 8) means ~1 fully-active quad device before `No more HCD channels`
- **busids** - physical-port based (`1-1` root, `1-1.<hub port>` behind a hub), stable across re-enumeration. Chained (multi-level) hubs can't be disambiguated - ESP-IDF exposes no parent handle, so devices on the same port number of different hubs would collide; a single hub is fine
- **100 Mbps Ethernet** - throughput limited by network, not USB bus speed (see Performance section)
- **ESP-IDF USB host stack** - some devices with multiple configurations may have enumeration issues
